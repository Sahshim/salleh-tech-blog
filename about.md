## About Me

Hi, I’m Salleh – an avid cloud, Linux, and networking enthusiast with a passion for building efficient systems and scalable infrastructure.

I'm also a certified personal trainer and a natural physique athlete, driven by discipline and consistency both in the gym and in the tech world.

After spending years in the heart of Silicon Valley, I’ve gained valuable experience that I now apply across cloud technologies, cybersecurity, and health-focused productivity.

This blog is where I share my journey, insights, and ideas with like-minded learners and professionals.
